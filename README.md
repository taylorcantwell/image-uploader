<h1 align="center">Welcome to image-uploader üëã</h1>

## Intro

This is a challenge from DevChallenges.io as seen here: https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx. This challenge involved building a full stack application that uploads images. I cheated on this one and only created the client side that just uses the Cloudinary API to handle the image hosting. Had a bit of fun with some CSS animations in this one and used the library react-dropzone for the drag and drop and validation functionality.

A demo can be found here: https://ecstatic-hoover-70015d.netlify.app/
